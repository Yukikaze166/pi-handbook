/**
 * agent-record-entry.ts — what a finished top-level agent leaves behind in the session.
 *
 * The live record is evicted about ten minutes after the agent finishes, read or
 * not, and is gone after a reload or a restart. Its completion notification
 * carries only a preview of the result and points at `get_subagent_result` for
 * the rest, so that pointer has to outlive the record: the final record is
 * appended to the session as this entry, and `get_subagent_result` falls back
 * to it.
 *
 * It is also what lets `Agent({ resume })` reopen an evicted agent: the entry
 * names the session file the conversation lives in, so the id the model holds
 * still leads somewhere after eviction, a reload or a restart.

/**
 * Whether an evicted agent's saved conversation can be reopened, and the

 * a workflow's `resume`, so all three refuse the same cases in the same words;
 * `reason` completes "Could not resume X —" and "cannot be resumed —".
 *
 * The file is checked here rather than left to SessionManager.open: that runs
 * inside runAgent, whose rejection lands on the record as an agent error, not
 * as a refusal. A `/new` in another pi window or a manual delete makes the
 * conversation unrecoverable (Claude Code's `not_reachable`); `gone` marks
 * that, and the no-file case, as refusals that can never clear.
 *
 * The Agent tool deliberately falls back to general-purpose for a type it
 * cannot resolve (#183), which covers a deleted file AND a merely disabled
 * one. A resume must not inherit that: reopening this conversation under a
 * different agent's prompt and tools is not continuing it, and the new record
 * would re-tombstone under the substitute, so the handle would never find its
 * way back. `@handle` and the Agent tool reload the agent files first.
 *
 * `worktreeLost` refuses for good, as Claude Code does ("its worktree no
 * longer exists"): the conversation's edits were made in a directory that is
 * gone, and reopening it in the parent's checkout or a fresh worktree would
 * continue that work somewhere it never happened.
